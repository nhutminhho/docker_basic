# Reservations
This method will reserve the assigned amount of resources to the Docker tasks during the creation time. 
Precondition: Swarm cluster with single node and resource 1GB Memory and 1 CPU.
You can verify actual resource setting by:
```sh
$ docker info
...
 Swarm: active
  NodeID: ezitv2n4r95bicityehs3y07r
  Is Manager: true
  ClusterID: xv9yty9he94uojnk1pzk54xuz
  Managers: 1
  Nodes: 1
...
 CPUs: 1
 Total Memory: 984.2MiB
```

### Memory Reservation
We start a Swarm service with command:
```sh
$ docker service create --reserve-memory="500m" --name memory-reservation alpine ping 8.8.8.8
```
reserve-memory: allow you to reserve 500 MB Memory for this task, the Swarm scheduler will schedule a new task only. We expect this service run normally.

After that we scale this service up to 03 tasks:
```sh
$ docker service scale memory-reservation=3
```
New tasks will be rejected and no containers will be created because there are no available memory resources on this Swarm cluster:
```sh
$ docker service scale memory-reservation=3
memory-reservation scaled to 3
overall progress: 1 out of 3 tasks 
1/3: running   [==================================================>] 
2/3: no suitable node (insufficient resources on 1 node) 
3/3: no suitable node (insufficient resources on 1 node)
```

### CPU Reservation
We start a Swarm service with command:
```sh
docker service create --reserve-cpu="0.5" --name cpu-reservartion alpine ping 8.8.8.8
```
reserve-cpu: allow you to reserve a half of one of the CPUs.the Swarm also scheduler will schedule a new task only and this service run normally.

After that we scale this service up to 03 tasks:
```sh
$ docker service scale cpu-reservartion=3
```
New tasks will be rejected and no containers will be created because there are no available cpu resources on this Swarm cluster:
```sh
$ docker service scale cpu-reservartion=3
cpu-reservartion scaled to 3
overall progress: 2 out of 3 tasks 
1/3: no suitable node (insufficient resources on 1 node) 
2/3: running   [==================================================>] 
3/3: running   [==================================================>] 
```
